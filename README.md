## (MFR) Myntra For Retailers
Our product addresses the above concern giving a scalable  tech solution. The system can calculate current trend score for many fashion products from different  websites at once. The portal displays the products from different website sorted by their trend score.  The fashion retailers can see the trending as well as lagging products on one single portal. Moreover, the system also predicts the future trend score using trend forecasting along with taking  fashion blogs into account. The fashion retailers can see the products which would be trending in  future as well as lagging in future. Using this portal, the fashion retailers can visualize current and  future trends of apparels and customize their fashion portfolio.

### Advantages:
Our idea is replicable to all fashion-centric e-commerce websites as it does not depend on the website to provide information such as ratings and reviews. Many websites do not support support such rating systems, so we are using keyword search volume as a metric.
Fashion attributes are extracted from images even when there is a lack of textual information.
Compared to other machine learning models, SARIMA considers seasonal variation to predict global trends.
### Limitations:
User cannot get absolute score about trendiness of an object.
There is no definite mechanism to determine the accuracy of our model with apparel trend curve.
